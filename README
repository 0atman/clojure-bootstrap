# sample-clojure-cloudbees

A good starting point for lein powered clojure apps - for deployment to cloudbees.

The cloudbees plugin (http://clojars.org/lein-cloudbees can help with deployment)

## Usage
	lein deps (the first time !)
	lein ring server

This will start the app - and open a browser. Hack away. 
Then go to cloudbees.com and get your credentials - punch them in. 

When finished: 
	
	lein cloudbees deploy

Be happy.
