# sample-clojure-cloudbees

A good starting point for lein powered clojure apps - for deployment to cloudbees. 
If you don't have one - signup at cloudbees.com (you can run apps for free on the PaaS)

The cloudbees plugin (http://clojars.org/lein-cloudbees) is shown here for deployment (no runtime dependency, of course)

## Usage
	lein deps (the first time !)
	lein ring server

This will start the app - and open a browser. Hack away. 
Then go to grandcentral.cloudbees.com and get your credentials - punch them in (see project.clj). 

When finished: 
	
	lein cloudbees deploy
	lein cloudbees list-apps
	lein cloudbees

Be happy.
